# Flutter To-Do App
# Overview
This Flutter To-Do App allows users to manage tasks with local data storage using Hive. 
Users can add new tasks, view existing tasks, mark tasks as completed, and delete tasks with a swipe gesture.

# Features
- Add Tasks: Create new tasks and save them locally.
- View Tasks: Display all tasks in a list.
- Mark Tasks as Completed: Check tasks as completed, which visually indicates completion by striking through the task text.
- Delete Tasks: Swipe to delete tasks using Flutter Slidable.

# How to use
To add tasks, tap the floating action button (FAB) with the `+` icon, enter the task description in the dialog box, and then tap "Save" to add the task to the list. To view tasks, they will be displayed in a list with a checkbox next to each task; completed tasks will show a strike-through. To mark tasks as completed, simply tap the checkbox next to a task, which will strike through the task text to indicate its completion. For deleting tasks, swipe left on a task to reveal the delete button, and then tap the delete button to remove the task from the list.

# Instructions to install APK
To run the app on Android Studio, open the project and connect an Android device or start an emulator. Click on the green "Run" button in the top toolbar or select "Run > Run 'app'" from the menu. For running the app as an APK, build the APK by navigating to "Build > Build Bundle(s) / APK(s) > Build APK(s)." Once the build is complete, locate the APK in the output directory and install it on your device.
